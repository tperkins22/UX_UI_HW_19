              entrepreneur background has given me leadership and customer relations experience. Working as a lab scientist since 2007, has given me the research skills and following a straightforward process. I think analytically, strategically and prioritize my time. I get satisfaction seeing a project from start to finish and all steps in between. I am excited to find a company to grow in and be apart of their culture and mission as a UX Researcher.</p></h3>
